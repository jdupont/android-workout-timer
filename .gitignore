Android gitignore

Goal: To preserve the gitignore that I've found to work best for Android development in AndroidStudio so I don't have to search for one every time I start a new project.

Updated: 10/11/2017

Gitignore:

# AndroidStudio files used to organize user modules -- need to be regenerated on each machine
# Content documented here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30737082/what-are-iml-files-in-android-studio
*.iml

# Gradle folder used for gradle internals -- needs to be regenerated on each machine
.gradle

# Local user properties should stay local
/local.properties

# Local user properties
/.idea/workspace.xml

# Should not share when generated by a Gradle build as documented here: https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544839-How-to-manage-projects-under-Version-Control-Systems
/.idea/libraries

# Properties of containing folder -- useful only on Mac
.DS_Store

# Build files

# Build files
.externalNativeBuild
